Mobs bugs + changes

* Ensure phoenix cannot burn through unswappable
    * Started, test
* Re-test mobs with midas and putting ability, as "air" was removed from the unswappable nodes list
    * snow biter and icesnake may need to have it in their custom lists ?
* Check ABMs respect protection?

Server-oriented changes

* Find a way to ensure that fire does not spread, without changing external mods...
    * exploding mobs use generic mobs_redo explode attack
    * mobs_redo uses tnt.explode which determines the fire type on its own
    * for now, this is on an ABM in fire mod - it may be that for NSSM deployment we will need to add a fire override mod...

API refactoring

* Split materials.lua into nodes, items, abms
    * in-progress

Cleanup + misc enhancements

* Make `_egg` marker consistent
    * Check if mobs are ever registered as items
    * Perhaps remove `_egg` designations altogether
    * Perhaps remove duck egg building recipes
