Crown molding, columns and baseboards of different styles.



If you want to add or remove a texture simply edit the table at the top of millwork.lua file.

Right now I have these textures: White, Sandstone, Desert Sand and Clay. The others are commented out. 

Each texture has 28 nodes so careful that you don't add too many textures.
